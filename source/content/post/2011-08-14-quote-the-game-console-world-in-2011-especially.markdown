> The game-console world in 2011, especially portables, is a bit like the PDA world in 2004: it’s being eaten by consolidation from more ubiquitous devices. Game consoles will always exist, but they will probably decline significantly in sales over the next decade and be relegated to smaller markets like “hardcore” gamers, much like high-end PC gaming.
