[Brightcove HTML5 support](http://www.brightcove.com/en/video-platform/solutions/html5):

 
> Brightcove’s automatic device detection dynamically switches between Flash and HTML5 player templates to suit the viewer’s device capabilities. This could probably mean a break-through for HTML5-based internet video and another step in solving the iPad “issue” to not supporting Flash. If the New York Times and the Time Magazine could go this route, the others might do the same soon.
