> The point of unit testing is to verify that the object’s public interface does what is expected of it. Unit tests show how the code works. The only thing that should be tested is the object’s public interface. That way, when you the developer want to change how the object is implemented, you only worry about if the object being tested still does what it is expected of it.

Too often people try to test functionality, too.
