[BlackBerry 6 sneak peak at WES 2010](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlO8KMv7Bx4&feature=player_embedded) They will never win on touch screen interfaces. Their only strengths were keyboard and corporate. They already abandoned the keyboard here. With better security features in iPhone 4.0 it might be pretty hard for RIM to find a market.
