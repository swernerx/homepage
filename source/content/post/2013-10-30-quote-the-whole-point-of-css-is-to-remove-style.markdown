> The whole point of CSS is to remove style definitions from the HTML. Some of these examples are a little too close to inline styling for my taste. Not to mention the terrible class names, which are clearly just that short to try and reduce the added HTML weight.

The quote is from the commentsâ€¦ the whole idea is pretty silly and most comments share that opinion as it seems.
