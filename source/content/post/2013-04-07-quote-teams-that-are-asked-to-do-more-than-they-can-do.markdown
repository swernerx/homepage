> Teams that are asked to do more than they can do will say, “We’ll try.” And they will try. This rarely works out well. To be sure of getting done, they’ll begin to over-estimate everything. In order to get done quickly, they’ll cut back on important aspects of work you can’t see. It’s like sweeping the dirt under the rug. They’ll do a little less testing than was needed. It’s OK, we’ll get a bug report and fix it then. They’ll keep the code a little less clean than it needs to be. It’s OK, we’ll clean it up later, and it won’t slow us down much.
