> Furthermore, while WebM is supposed to be patent-free, that has yet to be proven. Google has not made an official statement that it will shield companies from being sued over using WebM, so if you choose to use it and it turns out that WebM does violate some patents somehow, you’re on your own. Good luck.

A lot of quotable material in there :)
