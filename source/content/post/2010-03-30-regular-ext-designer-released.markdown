It’s interesting that this seems to be some kind of native application. It’s not based on Adobe AIR nor on ExtJS itself. After inspecting the package it seems it’s based on [Qt](http://qt.nokia.com/products) - which seems to be a good choice for creating a cross platform application. Still I have the feeling that no single Qt app out there reaches the native feeling you would like to enjoy on MacOS. But definitely better than Java :)
