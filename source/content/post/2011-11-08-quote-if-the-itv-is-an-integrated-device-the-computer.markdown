That’s effectively the problem with all these web enabled TVs at the moment. Next generation TVs really should be displays only. Don’t need legacy tuner support, Internet access, apps, SD card slots, network streaming, … Don’t even need any speakers.

 My Pioneer Kuro plasma panel is pretty much that. But it has still an integrated multi tuner.
