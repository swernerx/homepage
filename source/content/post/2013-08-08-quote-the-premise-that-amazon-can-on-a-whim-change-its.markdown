> The premise that Amazon can, on a whim, change its business model from selling other people’s products at a razor thin margin while investing in capital-intensive distribution to selling other people’s products at a large margin while not investing in capital-intesive distribution is not credible.

This seems to be a good argument not investing in Amazon right now. They are already super expensive and nobody really knows if they ever realize large margins.
