> The iPad was designed with an entirely different set of priorities than Macs or PCs. Someone may well produce a worthy iPad rival in the next year, but it’s not going to be something like HP’s Slate that runs Windows 7, an operating system that epitomizes the traditional set of computer design priorities.

Best review of the iPad with some “aha” effects: [Daring Fireball: The iPad](http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/the_ipad) - I had it on my list for about a week now, but it’s worth reading.
