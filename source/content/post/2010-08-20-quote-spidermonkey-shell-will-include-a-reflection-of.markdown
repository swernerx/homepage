> SpiderMonkey shell will include a reflection of the SpiderMonkey parser, made available as an in-JavaScript API. This makes it easier to write tools in JavaScript that manipulate JavaScript source programs, such as syntax highlighters or static analyses.

Pretty cool feature: [Parser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey/Parser_API) in Spidermonkey
