Wow. So why even bother with new versions then?

 API improvements make a library easier for new users and might even lead to better efficiency and better code for existing users. If even a real major version, like 2.0, is not allowed to do so thatâ€™s really bad. So jQuery is dead. Long live Ender, Zepto and all the other new libraries growing out of GitHub.
