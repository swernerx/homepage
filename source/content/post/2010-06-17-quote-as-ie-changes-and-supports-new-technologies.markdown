Right, I still have problems to understand what the hell this helps. Especially as all these compat modes are not exactly the same as the real browser. It would have been enough to support one IE6-like compat mode and then just offer recent technology for all others.

 Can’t imagine what would happen when other vendors would implement it the same way. Holy crap. Not manageable. They call it a “feature” - not sure if this should be funny.
