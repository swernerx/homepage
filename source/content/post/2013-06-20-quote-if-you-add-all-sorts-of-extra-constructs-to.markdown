> If you add all sorts of extra constructs to AngularJS to make it work like Ember, why not just use Ember in the first place?

Have experienced the same with other framework choices, too.

 * If you add widgets and stuff to *jQuery* to build a full blown RIA why not just use *qooxdoo*.
 * If you use *ant* and add a ton of stuff to process JavaScript and CSS why not use a tool made for it like *Jasy* or *Grunt*.
