> First, iPad will succeed. In a year, something similar to the iPad will come from Google. In two or three years at most, an iMac and a MacBook Pro with something resembling the iPad OS will arrive. It wonâ€™t just be iPad OS. It will be the full Mac OS X with a new UI covering all of it, and smart, instantly searchable databases to store documents with metadata, all of it open to developers. Then Microsoft will introduce its own version of everything, killing file managers once and for all. And during all this time, more of that data and metadata will be stored in the cloud, with local storage only acting as a cache. No more syncing between devices, no more hassles, no complications.
