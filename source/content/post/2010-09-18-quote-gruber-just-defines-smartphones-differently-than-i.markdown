> Gruber just defines smartphones differently than I do. As I see it, he defines a “smartphone” as what I call a “high-end smartphone” (iOS, Android, MeeGo, webOS, likely Windows Phone 7 and BlackBerry OS6, too).

I share Gruber’s opinion. [What “smartphone” means - QuirksBlog](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/09/what_smartphone.html)
