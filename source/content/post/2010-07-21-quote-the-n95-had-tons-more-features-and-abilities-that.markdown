Another lame comparison on Nokia vs. Apple. Not sure whether Toni is still too much in love with the dying Nokia. I really hope he will reach the point where he stops comparing data sheets. But maybe this is just part of being an analyst. I think that nearly everybody in the business got the idea that it’s about the “how” and not the “what” in the current decade of tech.
