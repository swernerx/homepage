> Nokia WebKit is staggeringly huge. Still, its traffic market share is modest; the average Nokia user doesn’t surf the web nearly as often as the average iPhone user. That could change, though, and your websites must be ready.

I’m definitely not sharing this opinion. Surfing on these devices sucks hard, independently from the actual pages surfed to. And as soon as Nokia improves the technology there might be basically not a lot more todo.

 Also: as long as there is no interest between competing sites supporting these legacy devices, it’s even more needless to spend resources into it. It quite a henn vs. egg issue but as a developer I am not interested doing the first step. At least as long as I am not forced to do it.
