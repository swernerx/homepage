> The out of the box experience of WebOS is incredible. In many ways, WebOS is what the Mac was 20 years ago: a better user experience, but a product no one is buying. If Apple is the new Microsoft (but with a better product!), WebOS is the new Mac. And Android is Linux. It’s the hacker’s OS. It’s for people who want to tinker, people who enjoy installing plugins and patches. It’s for users who recompile their kernel for fun. That doesn’t excite me.

Laughter of the moment.
