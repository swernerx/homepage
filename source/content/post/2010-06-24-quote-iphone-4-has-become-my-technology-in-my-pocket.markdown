> iPhone 4 has become my technology in my pocket. It’s not just my phone, music player and general-purpose Internet device, it’s now my go-to still and video camera as well. In fact, its photo and video quality is so great, I’ll be leaving my DSLR at home for anything that isn’t an obvious photo-op, shoot or dedicated travel destination.
