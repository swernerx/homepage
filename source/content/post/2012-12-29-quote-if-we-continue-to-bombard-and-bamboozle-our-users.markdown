> if we continue to bombard and bamboozle our users with cluttered interfaces that satisfy stakeholder committees but frustrate the people who actually want to use our sites – our users will retaliate by removing our designs altogether. It’s the web. Now more than ever, the user is in control of what she sees and when she sees it.
