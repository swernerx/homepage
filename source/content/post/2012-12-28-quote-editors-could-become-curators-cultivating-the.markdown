> Editors could become curators, cultivating the best work from both inside and outside the newsroom. A good curator rewards us for delegating our attentional choices to them. We still like to give this job to people instead of machines, because people are smart, creative, idiosyncratic, and above all personal. We can form a relationship with a good curator.

Interesting perspective for editors.
