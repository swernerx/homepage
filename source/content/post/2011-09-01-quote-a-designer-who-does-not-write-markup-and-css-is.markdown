The same situation for industrial design. Jonny Ive needs to verify his ideas for being realistically as well. I think a designer can do a much better job when having knowledge about the output technology. The only issue I have experienced as well: thinking too strongly with the boundaries in mind. Ideal might be a designer who is positioned between good knowledge of the target technology but still with enough creativity to challenge the developers/engineers.
