> People do not know what they want. They barely know what they need, but they definitely don’t know what they want. They’re conditioned by the limited imagination of what is possible. But very often, when focus groups are conducted, marketers listen to ten people who say they don’t like something, and then they don’t do it. If five people out of ten say they don’t like, they don’t do it. The “researchers” never probe beyond why the people don’t like what they don’t like. This just builds a platform of ignorance. Most of the time, focus groups are built on the pressure of ignorance.

Wow. Some excellent quotable material in there.
