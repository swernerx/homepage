> What I find interesting is that “Galaxy S” is Samsung’s branding, but the phones aren’t called that. Each carrier gives them their own names. How many real people will know that the T-Mobile Vibrant and AT&T Captivate are pretty much the same phone from different carriers? And “Android” doesn’t get mentioned at all. The word “Android” doesn’t get much play from the carriers, either.

This is a problem for the huge adoption of Android. Compared to iPhone, BlackBerry and even Windows, Android does not use the system name for Marketing. This makes it pretty hard for non-techies to find, compare and buy Android devices (if if they read about them).
