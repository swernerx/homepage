> I’m thinking more and more that PhoneGap Symbian using Qt for Symbian is the way to go. WRT is a great tool, for lightweight apps, but its performance is not good. Javascript animation simply can’t be handled, and extensive sensor interaction will crash the application. Initial tests on PhoneGap using Qt for Symbian were much better.
