> But right now it isn’t, and that’s Microsoft’s most serious problem. Windows Phone 7 runs an IE7 with some IE8 characteristics. A IE7/IE8 hybrid is not good enough because web developers will refuse to develop for it. They write iPhone/Android-compatible code, and increasingly support other WebKit-based browsers, as well as Opera.

Not sure about Opera. But clearly WebKit.
