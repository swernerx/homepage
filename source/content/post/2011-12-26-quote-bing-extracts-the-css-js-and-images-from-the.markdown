> Bing extracts the CSS, JS and images from the original download, and saves the CSS, JS and image data URIs in local storage. Bing saves the names of the stored files in a cookie. With every subsequent page request, the cookie informs the server which files are already saved locally, allowing the server to determine which assets, if any, need to be included in the response.
