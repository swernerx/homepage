> RIM’s only way forward seems to be this bet on QNX, its new phone platform.

Who would by RIM? No Apple, Microsoft, Nokia and Google for sure.

 My bet would be Samsung or Sony. Samsung has already Bada for low-end and devices using a in-house system. But even then QNX might be interesting for them. Sony is just not a big player in mobile anymore. Betting on Android is already not enough when having strong companies like HTC and Samsung in the same ballpark.
